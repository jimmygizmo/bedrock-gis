# About this /secrets/ directory

Place your prepared SSL certificate in the /secrets/ directory. Build automation for NGINX will copy the
certificate from /secrets/ into its proper location for use by NGINX.

You can keep anything in the /secrets/ directory which you do not want to go into the repository.

The .gitignore file ensures that the only thing from the /secrets/ directory which gets into the repo
is this about-secrets.txt file.
