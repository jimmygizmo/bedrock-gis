# React default non-javascript index.html references this VAR to construct the favicon.ico URL.
# THIS IS HERE FOR AN EXPERIMENT TO DETERMINE HOW TO HANDLE THIS VAR AND FOR FAVICON BEST PRACTICE ETC.
# Ultimately the favicon matters almost not at all in dev, so we could just hardcode anything if necessary,
# BUT HONESTLY, why would this ever need to be fully qualified? Should it not be absolute or relative and NOT
# fully qualified?

# This file is used by python-dotenv and can be used by a Javascript ecosystem and other facilities as well.
# Python-dotenv can search UP the directory structure for a .env file and so it is best to keep this at the project
# root. Always make sure your .gitignore will KEEP THIS FILE OUT OF THE REPOSITORY. This is where you will configure
# your secrets and other sensitive data for your applications. Mostly this is relevant here in the development context
# but you could also use this same file as part of your entire pipeline and this file could also store production
# values. In that case you would be doing environment-detection. There are many strategies. For proper security,
# however, this file is best used for non-production environments. In production, likely in a cloud, you should
# use the most secure method that cloud provides, which might also leverage environment variables, but they will be
# secured in a vault service or the equivalent and there will be secure (non-plain text and non-host-resident) methods
# of configuring your applications.
